Extraction Schema for Token Analysis

This document outlines the structured schema for extracting information related to
regulatory, legal, operational, governance, and insurance factors for various crypto
token    types. This schema is intended to be used with tools like LlamaExtract (potentially
as  a Pydantic model) to guide the information extraction process from source
documents (e.g., whitepapers, legal terms, audit reports).

Each extracted piece of information should ideally be accompanied by a reference to its
source within the analyzed document(s) (e.g., page number, section heading, URL if
applicable).
